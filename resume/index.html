<h1>Jayla's Web</h1>
<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Welcome all! My name is Jayla Morris. I'm age 19 and I am a current student at Seminole State College of Florida.
I am currently in school for <strong>Digital Media</strong>. I am a photographer and editor. I hope to be able to open my own business 
one day! My schooling is further enhancing my skills in editing so that I will be able to come out with even better photos.
I have done a few photoshoots so far dating back from high school and with each, I get better. Thank you for visiting my site.
