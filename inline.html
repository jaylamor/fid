In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p><p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</i>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130"> November 30</time>.</p><p><em>blackgoose@example.com<br>555-336-1800</em></p><p><small>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized.
